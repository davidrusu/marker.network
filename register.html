        <p>
          This one time code is used to generate a "device token", this device
          token can be used to read and write to your reMarkable tablet. It's
          important that you don't share this code with anyone otherwise you'd
          be handing over the keys to your personal notes and thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order for <strong>marker.network</strong> to function, we need to
          access the files on your tablet. To do this we store this device token
          on your computer. All interaction with the reMarkable cloud will
          happen from your computer. No one else will have access to this device
          token.
        </p>
        <p>
          To publish your site, we will upload the contents of a folder on your
          device to <strong>marker.network</strong>. You'll be prompted before
          we upload anything to be sure everything is in order.
