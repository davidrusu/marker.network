            The reMarkable Cloud service provided by reMarkable AS comes with
            some terms and conditions that seems to suggest that accessing your
            files from the reMarkable Cloud through third party software may
            lead to losing access to the reMarkable Cloud.
          </p>

          <p>
            This software has been carefully designed[1] to preserve your
            privacy as well as interact respectfully with the reMarkable Cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            We imagine the terms and conditions are designed to protect
            reMarkable Cloud from badly designed software, so we hope to have
            mitigated some risk there.
          </p>
          <p>
            With all that said, we can't make any guarantees, thus we want you
            to know that you may be violating reMarkable Cloud terms and
            conditions by using this software.
          </p>
